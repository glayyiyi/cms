It is assumed for the purposes of this document that if you choose to upload WPtouch 3 via FTP or SSH that you know how to do so, and are comfortable with the process of configuring permissions, etc.

= Directory Name =

WPtouch 3 must be installed in a directory called wptouch-pro off of the main WordPress plugins directory. You will still be able to activate the plugin when it is placed in another directory, but WPtouch will be unable to locate many of the required files, including CSS and Javascript.

= Activating the Plugin =

Activating your WPtouch 3 installation is a two step process.

First, you’ll verify your Account information with us. Second, you’ll add a license for the domain to receive automatic upgrades and support.

= Verify Your Account =

To verify your account credentials, first visit the WPtouch 3 administration page, found in your WordPress install at:

When the WPtouch 3 admin page loads, you’ll see a notice banner with a link to begin the activation process: click it.

You’ll now be taken to the account tab, and see two text inputs. Enter your account email address then License Key, and click the ‘Save Changes’ button at the bottom of the form.

When completed and successful, you’ll see a message indicating your next step to activate a license for this domain.
